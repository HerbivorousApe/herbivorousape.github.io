                <p>Hello, my name is Jason Bitterman.</p>
                <p>I am seeking employment as a Software Developer.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your consideration in viewing my portfolio below.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img class="about-image" src="images/me.png" alt="A picture of Jason Bitterman, ordinary human software developer.">
            <p>I am passionate about process improvement and raising the bar of quality. Best practices and thorough documentation are my jam. I have lived under the Lean Six Sigma and SAFe methods; I found aid and comfort in both. Structured methodologies, templates, best practices; these are the sword, shield, and armor used to fight chaos – and that is something over which I tend to geek out.</p>
            <p>I am anxious to get my hands dirty – to resume learning outside of the classroom, to rejoin a team; to charge into a project I know little about and pop out adept on the other side.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-bitterman" target="_blank">My LinkedIn profile</a> contains an outline of a large portion of my professional experience, skill sets, recommendations, and a list of recently acquired certifications. I keep my progress updated there.</p>

                <p>I have been programming most of my life. From ‘GOTO 10’ loops on my brother’s TRS 80 when I was six, typing code from magazines on the C64 to ‘load’ simple games, creating Mad-Libs in QBasic, and publishing websites to AOL at the speed of 56kbps.</p>
                <p>In my professional career I began by developing batch files to streamline installations and migrations for desktop and tech support. My years as a webmaster involved design, development, maintenance of websites, email, and domain services. As a Performance Analyst I designed and developed ETL systems for reporting and data analysis. My time as a Software Engineer immersed me into all things SAFe, involving full stack support of dozens of legacy applications and QA lead duties for flagship projects.</p>
                <p>My current chapter involves studying as best I can the range of skills to fill in any gaps, and expand my knowledge base, acquiring certifications where relevant. I am in the process of applying this knowledge building practice projects, to enhance understanding, and to build a better portfolio.</p>

                    <p>Weather This is my first attempt to apply MVC design. While I had not worked with MVC before, it always made sense, especially with team supported, enterprise applications.</p>
                    <p>This is a simple weather app tying to several different APIs to return location based on IP, or zip code, then loading a forecast. Primarily pulling from weather.gov, I found assistive services in ip-api.com and zippopotam.us.</p>
                    <p>I initially completed a console application and am currently working on a multi-project solution; leaving the console View, moving the Model and Controllers to a ‘Common’ project, and developing a web View. I expect this will soon evolve into my first go at Xamarin.</p>

                    <img src="images/MixTape-ss.png" class="modal-image blackbg">
                    <p>Having more thoroughly reacquainted myself with HTML/CSS/JS and exploring the MERN stack; I turned to bolstering my .NET experience. While I worked supporting dozens of applications, I had yet to really apply the fundamentals and create a project of my own from the ground up.</p>
                    <p>I spun up a quick Mad Lib console application, but wanted to expand a bit. A menu was added, as well as Escape the Maze (text-based adventure), and Wheel of Misfortune, a ‘guess the phrase’ type game. The resulting conglomeration is titled “Mix Tape”.</p>
                    <p>This is nothing award winning, but I was happy to get an original creation stamped out. Also, happy that I had retained much of what I learned as a Software Engineer. Looking at the code, there are things I would do differently today – and there are some glaring bugs. As I am moving forward, I’m content to let it stand where it is.</p>

                        <img src="images/bugs-animation.gif" class="modal-image">
                        <p>While studying for my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jason-bitterman/front-end-libraries" target="_blank">Front End Libraries certification</a> I decided to take a break to apply some of the covered material. I wanted to create a game.</p>
                        <p>What I settled on was <a href="https://codepen.io/herbivorousape/pen/JjGXgar" target="_blank">BUGS!</a> a very basic, somewhat <em>buggy</em>, whack-a-mole type. Ten hours, and about 300 lines of code later, I had it. </p>
                        <p>This was an interesting exercise, allowing me to reacquaint with jQuery – which I had not used since my webmaster days, stretch my vanilla JavaScript muscles, and play around with incorporating other libraries – something I typically avoid if I can help it. </p>
                        <p>I learned I’d rather work without jQuery, and that I really like Bootstrap. Animate.css was unnecessary, but helpful – Font Awesome was even less necessary, and less helpful. Though, I am happy to have the experience with all of it.</p>
                        <p>Short of a few code snippets in my old toolbox, this was my first real experience using setInverval to step through functions, which, is incredibly simple, incredibly powerful.</p>
                        <p>I am especially happy with the dynamically created grid, the, (admittedly imperfect, but present), scalability, randomized animations pulling from arrays. I recall overcoming challenges such as being able to continue accumulating points after time ran out, and being able to squish bugs when paused.</p>
                        <p>Looking at it now there are things I would do differently – I still have an itch to expand functionality, and may one day. For now, it’s my first non-text-based game. I built it from scratch. I learned a lot, including a bit more about of what I am capable. </p>

                        <p>&quot;Hello, World!&quot;, the calculator exclaimed. &quot;Hello Calculator&quot;, the world labeled back.</p>
                        <p>This application originates from a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator" target="_blank">Free Code Camp, Front End Libraries, certification project</a>.</p>
                        <p>There isn’t much to it on the surface. A basic calculator in function; layout roughly mirroring the keypad on my keyboard, with a ‘clear’ option where the Num Lock should be. Keys are clickable and bound to their keyboard counterparts, with ’c’ triggering clear.</p>
                        <p>The aesthetic is somewhat styled around an older model calculator with green LED display. Bootstrap CSS made short work of the styling.</p>
                        <p>React was used; more for practice than necessity, but it was helpful in execution, and in gaining familiarity with the library.</p>
                        <p>I initially thought building a calculator should be one of the easier applications to code. While this project met many of those expectations – I learned calculators use much more logic than I once thought; which ultimately gives me a greater perspective on programming generally. Nothing requiring intent happens accidentally. (I know it’s oxymoronic, but it’s concise and meaningful.)</p>
                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_input_methods" target="_blank">Calculator input methods</a> especially were something I never considered existing. I opted to run formula logic as it seemed a bigger challenge, and also was most convenient to QA with the Windows calculator.</p>

                        <p>&quot;I don’t have drum noises.&quot; I replied.</p>
                        <p><em>&quot;All we’re looking for is audio on keypress.&quot;</em></p>
                        <p>&quot;Fantastic! Yes! This is great. I have just the thing.&quot;</p>
                        <p>This was a fun one; not just because the only audio I had handy were MP3s from AOE II: Forgotten Empires, but it was my first real React application. </p>
                        <p>It was extremely satisfying creating something so simple, concise, and scalable.  </p>
                        <p>So much pulls from a ‘drumpads’ array – the button grid and the bulleted list are both generated based on the information therein. The application designates the assigned key, label/phrase, and location of the audio track. Any items added to this array manifest this information to the grid and list. </p>
                        <p>It’s not exactly the drum machine intended, but it technically meets all the requirements. A solid minimum viable product ready to accept the client’s next iteration of requests.</p>
